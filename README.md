Optimising Revenue of a sports company using SQL

In this project, I utilise advanced SQL to examine product data such as pricing, reviews, revenue and
website traffic, for an online sports retail company.
I apply SQL techniques like aggregation, cleaning, labelling, and correlation to produce
recommendations on how the company can maximise revenue.
